## RPI Interactive Campus Map ##

A webapp that will allow users to easily find spots on campus and in the surrounding area, and map a route to their destination. Users can also post relevant photos and comments on locations' info pages.

This project was started as a term project for the ITWS-2110 (Web Systems Development) class at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, under the supervision of Professor Thilanka Munasinghe. It is now being developed and maintained through the Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS).

We are currently in the middle of a large refactor, so it is messy and not very functional, but heavy construction will be over soon!
