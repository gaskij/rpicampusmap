# RPI Machines Map #


This is a webapp that will allow users to easily find machine shops on campus, and the contents of those shops. This project exists as a branch of [RPI Interactive Campus Map](documentation/CM_README.md).

RPI Machines Map has a map legend that allows users to view regular campus locations (non-shop locations), just machine shops, or both. The machine shops are also searchable by the machines at their sites, allowing users to know where to go on campus, based on their mechanical needs.

This project was originally commissioned by Sam Chiappone (Director of Manufacturing Innovation) and Scott Yerbury (Electromechanical Technician/ Machine Shops Manager). It is now being developed and maintained through the Rensselaer Center for Open Source (RCOS).

### Getting Started
To contribute to RPI Machines Map, see the getting started guide in [documentation/CM_README.md](CM_README.md). Then, switch to the Machines Map branch by running the command `git checkout forgemill` for the stable version and `git checkout forgemill-dev` for the developers branch. Most changes will most likely go on the developer's branch, and changes should only be pushed to the stable branch if you are sure your code is not broken.

To read more about the technologies used in this project, see the 'documentation' folder in the forgemill-dev branch.
